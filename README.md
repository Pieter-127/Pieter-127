### Hello 

My name is Pieter (pronounced the same as Peter) and I'm an android dev, trying to learn as much as possible.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on compose and whatever comes from doing that.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning flutter and trying to learn some backend development as well, although finding time for everything is always a challenge.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything making use of kotlin, compose and material design.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my profile picture (you'll get a random reply because I don't really know where it's from, it's followed me for years)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm a ghost in the system, if you can reach me, that's an achievement :)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- One of my favourite quotes : "There is no great genius without some touch of madness."

Here are some of the apps available on my github - it's a work in progress.
