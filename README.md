### Hello 

My name is Pieter (pronounced the same as Peter) and I'm an android dev, trying to learn as much as possible.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on compose and whatever comes from doing that.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning flutter and trying to learn some backend development as well, although finding time for everything is always a challenge.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything making use of kotlin and material design.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my profile picture (you'll get a random reply because I don't really know where it's from, it's followed me for years)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm a ghost in the system, if you can reach me, that's an achievement :)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- One of my favourite quotes : "There is no great genius without some touch of madness."

Here are some images from apps I've either worked on or which are available on my github (only side projects, nothing work related). I have a private bitbucket with more apps and playgrounds but most of those remain private. If I ever find something with a cool design I'll try to recreate it, even without functionality.
