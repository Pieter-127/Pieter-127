### Hello 

My name is Pieter and I'm an android dev, trying to learn as much as possible.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning as much of android as possible, I have a full-time job and do side projects when I find time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning (whenever I have time, which isn't very often) flutter, although this is going very slowly
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything making use of kotlin and material design
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with being smuggled into Canada :D  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my profile picture (you'll get a random reply because I don't really know where it's from, it's followed me for years)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm a ghost in the system, if you can reach me, that's an achievement :)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

To G K K, you will always be my champion and my best friend. Thank you for getting me to where I am today and enabling me to go even further.

Here are some images from apps I've either worked on or which are available on my github (only side projects, nothing work related)
